lib_loader
==========

This is my attempt at an rtld (RunTime Link eDitor)

It mostly works... it requires a number of "fixups" do be defined before loading a library.

The zlib/zlib_list.c has a good example of how to do the fixup.

Things that need to be done:
<pre>
 * Write a makefile
 * Write documentation
 * Refactor the code
 * Test everything
</pre>

If you're actually attempting to look at this right now: good luck.
